# Database Migration Workflow

This guide explains how to create and apply database schema migrations using Prisma. The TricklePay backend uses migration files rather than schema pushes to track and version database changes.

## Overview

The project uses [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) as the database toolkit and ORM. Schema changes are made by:

1. Editing `prisma/schema.prisma`
2. Creating a migration file with `prisma migrate dev`
3. Applying the migration to the database

Migrations are version-controlled SQL files stored in `prisma/migrations/`. Each migration is applied in order, and Prisma tracks which migrations have been run using a `_prisma_migrations` table.

## When to Create a Migration

Create a migration whenever you change the database schema in `prisma/schema.prisma`:

- Adding a new model (table)
- Adding, removing, or modifying fields
- Changing field types or constraints
- Adding or removing indexes
- Altering relationships between models

## Creating a Migration

### Step 1: Edit the Schema

Make your changes in `prisma/schema.prisma`. For example, adding a new field:

```prisma
model Stream {
  streamId      BigInt   @id
  sender        String
  recipient     String
  // ... existing fields ...
  
  // New field
  description   String?  // Optional description
}
```

### Step 2: Generate the Migration

Run the migration command with a descriptive name:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_description_to_streams
```

**What this does:**
1. Compares `schema.prisma` to the current database state
2. Generates SQL migration files in `prisma/migrations/<timestamp>_add_description_to_streams/`
3. Applies the migration to your local database
4. Regenerates the Prisma Client with the updated types

**Alternative (shorthand):**
```bash
npm run prisma:migrate
```

This runs `prisma migrate dev` and prompts you for a migration name.

### Step 3: Review the Migration

Check the generated SQL in `prisma/migrations/<timestamp>_<name>/migration.sql`:

```sql
-- AlterTable
ALTER TABLE "Stream" ADD COLUMN "description" TEXT;
```

**Important:** Review the SQL before committing. Prisma usually generates correct migrations, but complex schema changes may require manual adjustments.

### Step 4: Commit the Migration

Commit both the schema change and the generated migration:

```bash
git add prisma/schema.prisma prisma/migrations/
git commit -m "feat: add description field to Stream model"
```

## Applying Migrations

### Development (Local)

Migrations are applied automatically when you run:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
```

This is already wired into the `npm run prisma:migrate` script.

### Production / CI

Use the `migrate deploy` command, which applies pending migrations without prompting:

```bash
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

This command:
- Applies all unapplied migrations in order
- Does NOT create new migrations
- Does NOT regenerate the Prisma Client (do that at build time)
- Fails if the migrations directory is out of sync with the database

**When to use:**
- Production deployments
- CI/CD pipelines
- Docker container startup

The `Dockerfile` in this repository runs `prisma migrate deploy` automatically when the container starts.

### Docker Compose

When using `docker compose up`, migrations are applied automatically by the `api` service's entrypoint. No manual intervention is needed.

## Typical Workflow

### Scenario 1: Adding a New Field

```bash
# 1. Edit prisma/schema.prisma
vim prisma/schema.prisma

# 2. Generate and apply migration
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_new_field

# 3. Verify the migration
cat prisma/migrations/<timestamp>_add_new_field/migration.sql

# 4. Commit
git add prisma/
git commit -m "feat: add new field to model"
```

### Scenario 2: Renaming a Field

Prisma may generate a DROP + ADD instead of a RENAME. To preserve data, manually adjust the migration SQL:

```bash
# 1. Edit schema (rename field)
# 2. Generate migration
npx prisma migrate dev --name rename_field

# 3. Edit the migration SQL to use ALTER TABLE ... RENAME COLUMN
vim prisma/migrations/<timestamp>_rename_field/migration.sql

# 4. Re-apply
npx prisma migrate resolve --applied <timestamp>_rename_field
npx prisma generate
```

### Scenario 3: Rolling Back a Migration (Development Only)

If you applied a bad migration locally and haven't pushed it:

```bash
# Reset the database to the last good state
npx prisma migrate reset

# This will:
# - Drop the database
# - Recreate it
# - Re-apply all migrations
# - Re-run seed data (if configured)
```

**Warning:** `migrate reset` is destructive. Only use it in development.

## Best Practices

1. **Name migrations descriptively:** Use `add_field_name`, `create_table_name`, `remove_index`, etc.
2. **Review generated SQL:** Prisma is smart, but not perfect. Check complex migrations.
3. **Test migrations locally first:** Apply migrations in dev before pushing.
4. **Commit migrations with schema changes:** The `.prisma` file and the `migrations/` folder should be committed together.
5. **Never edit applied migrations:** Once a migration is applied and pushed, treat it as immutable. Create a new migration to fix issues.
6. **Use `migrate deploy` in production:** Never use `migrate dev` in production — it can prompt for input and is not idempotent.

## Common Issues

### Issue 1: "Migration is not in the migrations directory"

**Cause:** Your local migrations folder is out of sync with the database's `_prisma_migrations` table.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Pull the latest migrations
git pull

# Apply missing migrations
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

### Issue 2: "Schema drift detected"

**Cause:** Manual database changes were made outside Prisma's migration system.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Option 1: Create a new migration to match the drift
npx prisma migrate dev --name sync_manual_changes

# Option 2: Reset dev database (destructive)
npx prisma migrate reset
```

### Issue 3: Prisma Client types are stale after migration

**Cause:** The migration was applied, but the Prisma Client wasn't regenerated.

**Solution:**
```bash
npx prisma generate
```

Or use the npm script:
```bash
npm run prisma:generate
```

## Migration Commands Reference

| Command | Use Case | Safe for Production? |
|---------|----------|----------------------|
| `prisma migrate dev` | Create and apply migrations locally | ❌ No |
| `prisma migrate deploy` | Apply pending migrations | ✅ Yes |
| `prisma migrate reset` | Reset database and re-apply all migrations | ❌ No (destructive) |
| `prisma migrate resolve` | Mark a migration as applied/rolled-back | ⚠️ Use with caution |
| `prisma migrate status` | Check which migrations are pending | ✅ Yes (read-only) |
| `prisma generate` | Regenerate Prisma Client | ✅ Yes |

## Integration with npm Scripts

The project's `package.json` includes these convenience scripts:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "prisma:generate": "prisma generate",
    "prisma:migrate": "prisma migrate dev"
  }
}
```

- `npm run prisma:generate`: Regenerate Prisma Client types (after pulling schema changes)
- `npm run prisma:migrate`: Create and apply a new migration (development only)
